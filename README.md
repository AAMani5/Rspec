Just trying out Rspec for the first time.

1. Intro Folder  - testing a ruby script that greets a person with his or her name.
2. roman_numerals - testing a ruby script that converts decimal numbers to roman numbers. I also tested Git Pong between this folder & a branch(pairing) in playing-with-git repo.
